# üêç Python Datalogger for debugging embedded systems 
  
Like ESP WIFI modules, microcontrollers, Linux serial console etc.

With this program it's possible to save logs from different serial ports just by [configuring the JSON file](#-configuring) (`config.json`), the number of ports and unlimited and each process for processing and saving the logs is with you on separate instances and threads.


## üöÄ Run the application

create a virtual environment to isolate our package dependencies locally (first run time)
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

On Windows use:
```bash 
`env\Scripts\activate`
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application, simply execute:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## üíª Install as a service
To install the app as a service, just run:
```bash
cd services && sudo ./install.sh
```

To find the tty port associated with your microcontroller using the `ls /dev/serial/by-path` command, follow these steps:

1. Connect your microcontroller to the computer via the serial port;
2. Open a terminal and execute the command `ls /dev/serial/by-path` to list the available serial devices;
3. Look at the list to identify the device associated with your microcontroller. Typically, the name of the symbolic link includes information about the manufacturer or model of the device;
4. Fill in the serialid parameter of the devices in the [`config.json`](config.json) file with the following path: `/dev/serial/by-path/<id-returned-by-previous-command>`

> By using this path to access the serial device instead of the port number (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`), the operating system will always point to the correct device, regardless of how many times the microcontroller is disconnected and reconnected.

Using file `config.json` for configuration for one or multiple serial ports: 
 
Example two serial ports: 
```json

    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "server": "url",
    "port": 1883,

  },

}
```

> Note: To commit a new [config.json](config.json) file as example execute: `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged config.json`, commit changes and execute again: `git update-index --assume-unchanged config.json`

> Note: The capacity of the data logger depends only on the CPU and disk IO speeds!

##  üë∑ Development

Install pre-commit for automatic code verifications

```bash 
pip install pre-commit
```

```bash 
pre-commit --version
```

Install the git hook scripts

```bash 
pre-commit install

## üß™ Testing

If you're looking to run a program to send data via serial to your microcontroller, check out the [`example/arduino`](example/arduino) directory in this repository. You'll find a simple **PlatformIO** project that provides tests for sending data over serial communication with an Arduino microcontroller. Simply navigate to the [`example/arduino`](example/arduino) directory in this repository and run the project with **PlatformIO** to get started.

***
## Troubleshooting

If you are not running "pybluez", install the following dependencies:

```bash 
sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth-dev
```
For scan devices:

bluetoothctl
